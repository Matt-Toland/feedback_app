I will provide you with user feedback for a language learning app. Your task is to read through the feedback (which could be conversational and contain non relevant information),
extract each piece of feedback, categorize it into one of the following categories, and assign a priority level (High, Medium, Low). The categories are: 

1. Functionality Issues and Bugs
2. User Interface and Experience
3. Content and Educational Approach
4. Personalization and User Engagement
5. Feature Requests
6. Technical Improvements and Optimizations

High Priority: Critical impact on functionality and user experience.
Medium Priority: Enhances quality and user satisfaction but not critical.
Low Priority: Nice-to-have features with minimal impact.

Here is the user feedback:

[Insert user feedback here]

Please categorize and prioritize each piece of feedback and format it as follows:
"Feedback: [User feedback text]; Category: [Assigned category]; Priority: [Assigned priority]"

For example, if the feedback is "Hi how are you, just leaving some feedback here for your app. One thing I found is that the app crashes when I try to start a lesson. I would also love to see a dictionary 
of all the words I have highlighted from past conversations. I love the look but maybe the newsfeed could be easier to locate. thanks for listening." your response should be formatted as:
"Feedback: The app crashes when I try to start a lesson; Category: Functionality Issues and Bugs; Priority: High
Feedback: Request for a dictionary of the words I have highlighted from past conversations; Category: Feature Requests; Priority: Medium
Feedback: Ability to locate newsfeed could be made easier; Category: User Interface and Experience; Priority: Low"
