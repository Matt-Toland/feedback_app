it. Okay, so I've started the recording. One sec. Yeah, go for it. Mike, did you see the game last night? What a comeback by our team. Oh, you bet. The last minute goal was insane. All right, let's grab a coffee then and dive straight into the agenda. So Mike, about predicting customer churn behavior, I've been thinking about the data we'll need for the machine learning models. We'll need historical consumer data, correct? Absolutely. We'll need things like customer demographics, transaction history, support, ticket interactions, and any feedback we've provided. Right. We'll also need to make sure the data is clean and properly pre-processed. That's crucial for the accuracy of our models. Agreed. We should also consider incorporating features like customer engagement metrics and product usage data. Good point. That'll give us a more holistic view of the customer's interaction with our platform. Now, let's talk algorithms. We could start with a logistic regression for a baseline and then explore more advanced techniques like decision trees, random forests, and even neural networks. Sounds like a plan. Ensemble methods like random forests might be particularly useful given the complexity of customer behavior. Right. And we can also experiment with different feature selection techniques to refine our model. Moving on to risks. One concern I have is overfitting, especially if we have a lot of features. We'll need to be cautious about that. Agreed. We should also be mindful of biases in the data that could lead to biased predictions. We'll need to address that in our pre-processing. Absolutely. We should also think about how we'll validate our model's performance and consider using techniques like cross-validation. Good point. Now, next steps. I think we should start by gathering the data and doing some initial exploratory analysis. Agreed. I'll also start experimenting with different algorithms and feature combinations to see what performs best. And I'll work on setting up a validation framework to ensure our model is robust. Sounds like a plan. Let's meet next week to review our progress. All right. Before we wrap up, any other points we should cover? I think we've got a solid plan. Let's go to work. Thank you.
